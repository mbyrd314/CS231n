# CS231n
Solutions to the assignments in Stanford's Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition course

My code is largely found in the sections between where it says "TODO" and "END OF YOUR CODE" in each file. The .py.bak files were created when using a script to convert from Python 2 to Python 3.

The solutions to assignments 1 and 2 should run correctly as they are in this repository, but assignment 3 will not. This is because assignment 3 contained a dataset of images that was over 2 GB in size, which was too large to send using Github. So if you want to run the files in assignment 3, you will have to download the datasets from the CS231n website and save them to the cs231n directory of assignment3.
